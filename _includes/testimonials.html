        <p class="p-4 md:pt-4 md:px-12">The bike project has allowed me to maintain a fleet of bikes for a family of 5 and affordably upgrade my daughter’s bikes as they outgrow them annually. But the real fun has been learning the practical, mechanical skills of bike maintenance along the way. In a country that’s moving toward machines with “no user-serviceable parts inside” and treats consumer goods as disposable, the bike project is a welcome harbor for those who like to tinker and see value in used things.<span class="block text-sm md:text-base italic font-light flex md:justify-end">- Seth Brown</span></p>
